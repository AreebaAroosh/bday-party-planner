# Birthday Party Planner

This app is intended for small companies that have established social gatherings for their employees. In most of the cases there is too much work to be done when only one person is organizing the party. The main idea of this app is to include all employees and encourage them to contribute their part in the organization. Birthday boys and girls will organize the party, gift buyers will define a list of ideas for the gifts and go buy them and other guests will contribute their ideas for the people who are celebrating. This app helps coordinating everyone involved by sending them reminders and guide them through their tasks.
